-   Understand what is meant by full stack in the context of web development
-   Distinguish between front-end, back-end and full stack web development
-   Understand the position of this course in the context of this specialization

-   Understand what is meant by full stack in the context of web development
-   Distinguish between front-end, back-end and full stack web development
-   Understand the position of this course in the context of this specialization

### Introduction to Node.js and NPM: Objectives and Outcomes

In this lesson you will learn the basics of Node.js and NPM. Thereafter, you will install Node.js and NPM on your machine so that you can start writing simple Node applications. At the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

-   Download and install Node.js and NPM on your machine
-   Verify that the installation was successful and your machine is ready for using Node.js and NPM.

### Node and HTTP: Objectives and Outcomes

In this lesson you will learn more about the Node HTTP core module. You will create a simple HTTP server using the Node HTTP module and serve HTML files from a public folder. Along the way you will learn about the fs and path Node core modules. At the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

-   Create a simple HTTP server using the Node HTTP core module
-   Create a web server to serve static HTML files from a folder

### Introduction to Express: Objectives and Outcomes

In this lesson you will learn about the Express framework that enables implementing and deploying powerful web servers based on Node. At the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

-   Implement a web server using the Express framework
-   Develop a web server that supports a REST API
-   Use Express router to implement support for the REST API

Week 2:

### Express Generator: Objectives and Outcomes

In this lesson you will learn about Express generator, a scaffolding tool to quickly generate an Express application with typical support for routes. You will then build an Express server to support REST API. At the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

-   Quickly scaffold out a typical Express application using express-generator
-   Build an Express server to support REST API

### Introduction to MongoDB: Objectives and Outcomes

In this lesson you will learn the basics of MongoDB. You will download and setup MongoDB, and will interact with a MongoDB server using the mongo REPL shell. At the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

-   Explain the salient features of MongoDB and understand the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases.
-   Download, install and run a MongoDB server and interact with it from the mongo REPL shell.

### Node and MongoDB: Objectives and Outcomes

In this lesson, you will learn about the Node MongoDB driver module and how you can leverage it to communicate from your Node application with a MongoDB server. You will use the Node module to perform various database operations. At the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

-   Configure your Node application to communicate with a MongoDB server
-   Perform various database operations on the MongoDB server from your Node application using the Node MongoDB driver.

### Mongoose ODM: Objectives and Outcomes

In this lesson you will learn about Mongoose ODM and its use in setting up schemas and models to use MongoDB. At the end of this lesson you will be able to:

-   Define and construct Mongoose schemas and models
-   Interact with MongoDB server using Mongoose from your Node application.
### REST API with Express, MongoDB and Mongoose: Objectives and Outcomes

In this lesson you will integrate the REST API that you developed with the Express framework earlier together with the Mongoose schemas and models and the MongoDB database to provide the complete end-to-end implementation of the server to support REST API. At the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

-   Develop a full-fledged REST API server with Express, MongoDB and Mongoose
-   Implement the end-to-end solution integrating Express, Node and Mongo.
